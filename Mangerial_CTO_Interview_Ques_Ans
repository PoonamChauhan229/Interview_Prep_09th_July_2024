Q: How do you manage API integration in your applications?
> To manage API integration, we use tools like Axios or Fetch for sending and receiving data via RESTful APIs.
We handle data fetching and updates asynchronously to keep our application responsive. Error handling is crucial, 
so we display clear messages for users and log errors for troubleshooting. 
This helps us ensure smooth communication and reliability with external APIs.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q: Can you explain how you would set up authentication and authorization in a single-page application?
> To set up authentication and authorization in a single-page application (SPA), we use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
After a user logs in, the server sends a JWT to the client, which we store securely in HTTP-only cookies. 
We protect routes by checking for a valid JWT before allowing access.
Libraries like Firebase can help simplify and secure this process.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q. Describe a complex problem you solved in a previous project.
> One complex problem I faced was inconsistent API responses, resulting in different data sets each time.
To address this, we implemented a filtering mechanism based on unique IDs to ensure consistent and relevant data.
Additionally, we introduced a caching strategy using React's useMemo to memoize the filtered data,
reducing the need for repeated API calls and improving performance and reliability.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q: How do you handle cross-browser compatibility issues?
>To handle cross-browser compatibility issues, we can use
Autoprefixer: Automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules.

Q: How would you design the front-end architecture for a large-scale application?
> To design the front-end architecture for a large-scale application, 
I would organize components modularly, use Redux or Context API for state management,and implement React Router for navigation. 
Data fetching would be managed with Axios or Fetch and optimized with React Query.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q: You have a React component that re-renders frequently and affects performance. How would you address this issue?
> To address frequent re-renders in a React component, 
I would use useCallback to memoize callback functions and useMemo to memoize expensive computations,
ensuring they are only recalculated when dependencies change. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q: You notice that a page is taking a long time to load. How would you diagnose and address this issue?
> I would use browser DevTools to check network requests and find large or slow resources. 
Then, I'd optimize images, delay loading of non-essential JavaScript, and use lazy loading for images and other content
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q: What is your approach to ensuring a web application is scalable and maintainable?
> I use a modular design, write clean and readable code, and manage state properly.
I also make sure to test everything thoroughly. This keeps the application easy to maintain and scale.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q: How do you approach lazy loading of components and assets in a React application?
> Lazy loading is the practice of delaying load or initialization of resources or objects until they’re actually needed to improve performance.
For example, if a web page has an image that the user has to scroll down to see,
you can display a placeholder and lazy load the full image only when the user arrives to its location.
